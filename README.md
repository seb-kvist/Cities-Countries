# Cities and Countries Web Application

## Overview
This web application allows users to explore countries and cities. Users can click on a country to see a list of cities within it, view detailed information about a city, and mark cities they have visited. The visited cities are saved in the browser's local storage and can be viewed and cleared by the user.

### Key Features:
- **Countries List:** Displays a list of countries fetched from a `land.json` file.
- **Cities by Country:** When a country is clicked, a list of cities within that country is shown, fetched from a `stad.json` file.
- **City Details:** Clicking a city shows detailed information such as population and an option to mark it as "visited".
- **Visited Cities:** Users can see the cities they have marked as visited. The visited cities are stored in the browser's local storage and can be cleared.
- **Search Functionality:** A search bar allows users to search for countries and cities by name.
- **Error Handling:** Messages are shown when a city is already marked as visited or when there is an issue with adding/removing cities from the visited list.

## Files:
- **index.html:** The main HTML file that holds the structure of the page.
- **styles.css:** The CSS file for styling the application.
- **script.js:** The JavaScript file that contains the logic for fetching data, handling events, and managing local storage.
- **land.json:** A JSON file containing a list of countries.
- **stad.json:** A JSON file containing a list of cities and their respective countries.
